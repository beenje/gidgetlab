Installation
------------
Gidgethub is `available on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gidgethub/>`_.
::

  python3 -m pip install gidgethub


Goals
-----

The key goal is to provide a base library for the
`GitHub API <https://developer.github.com/>`_ which performs no I/O of its own (a
`sans-I/O <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/>`_ library). This allows users to
choose whatever HTTP library they prefer while parceling out GitHub-specific
details to this library. This base library is then built upon to provide an
abstract base class to a cleaner API to work with. Finally, implementations of
the abstract base class are provided for asynchronous HTTP libraries for
immediate usage.


Alternative libraries
---------------------

If you think you want a different approach to the GitHub API,
`GitHub maintains a list of libraries <https://developer.github.com/libraries/>`_.


*Aside*: what's with the name?
------------------------------

I couldn't think of a good name that was somehow a play on "GitHub" or somehow
tied into `Monty Python <http://www.montypython.com/>`_. And so I decided to play
off of GitHub's `octocat <https://octodex.github.com/>`_ as a theme and use my
cat's name, Gidget, as part of the name. Since "Gidget" somewhat sounds like
"git", I decided to go with "gidgethub".


Changelog
---------

3.0.0 (in development)
''''''''''''''''''''''

- ``gidgethub.sansio.RateLimit.from_http`` returns ``None`` if ratelimit is
  not found in the headers.

2.5.0
'''''

- Tighten type hints for parameters that have a default of ``None``
  but were not typed as ``Optional``.

- Tweak code to not change semantics but reach 100% coverage.

- Provide a human-readable string representation of
  ``gidgethub.sansio.RateLimit``.

- Use the ``message`` data as the error message
  if the ``errors`` object was not returned.

- Add the *data* keyword argument to ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.delete``.


2.4.1
'''''

- Tighten up protections against caching ineligible responses.


2.4.0
'''''

- Expand ``gidgethub.routing.Router.dispatch()``.


2.3.0
'''''

- Add support for ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` webhook event payloads.
  (This also allows for API calls to return this content type, although GitHub
  currently does not do that.)

- Introduce ``gidgethub.routing`` to help route webhook events to registered
  asynchronous callbacks.

- Add type hints.

- Add a *cache* argument to ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI``.


2.2.0
'''''

- Introduce ``gidgethub.tornado`` to support
  `Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ (thanks to
  Matthias Bussonnier and A. Jesse Jiryu Davis for the PR reviews).


2.1.0
'''''

- The default value for the *data* argument of ``gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI.put()``
  was changed from ``""`` to ``b""``.
- All type hints were removed (due to mypy not supporting yield in an async
  function, they were not being tested as being valid).


2.0.0
'''''

- Renamed ``gidgethub.abc._sleep()`` to ``sleep()`` to make the method public.
- Renamed the "test" extra to "tests" and added the "dev" extra.
- Introduced the ``RateLimitExceeded`` exception.
- Methods on ``GitHubAPI`` no longer automatically sleep when it's
  possible that the call will exceed the user's rate limit (it's now up to the
  user to prevent from going over the rate limit).
- Made the ``[treq]`` install extra depend on ``Twisted[tls]``.


1.2.0
'''''

- ``gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http()`` raises a ``BadRequest`` of ``415``
  instead of ``400`` when a content-type other than ``application/json``
  is provided.
- More robustly decode the body in ``gidgethub.sansio.Event.from_http()``
  (i.e. if the ``content-type`` doesn't specify ``charset``, assume ``UTF-8``).
- Changed the signature of ``gidgethub.sansio.Event`` to accept ``Any`` for
  the *data* argument.
- Fixed signature verification.


1.1.0
'''''

- Introduced ``gidgethub.treq`` (thanks to Cory Benfield).
